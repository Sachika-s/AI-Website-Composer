## About 

This autonomous web design engine is a full-stack application which allows users to create end-to-end websites under a few simple prompts. Used E2B and Docker to execute user’s prompts in secure cloud sandboxes. Moreover, OpenAI is responsible for code generation according to the User’s prompts. This application also provides pre-determined prompts and also integrates features such as dark/light mode. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
